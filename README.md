# weather-station-esp32
My first project is related to the Embedded System Programming field.
This project aims to create a low-cost, easy-to-install system that monitors notable weather elements (temperature, humidity, rainfall, light intensity).
The system includes an array of affordable sensors (DHT22, MH-RD rain sensor, LDR) along with an ESP32 that acts as the processing unit.
Weather data will be transmitted to the Blynk IoT app in the form of a complete dashboard.
